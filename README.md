# Regression-Project-on-Coorporation-Favorita
Time Series Project on Corporation Favorita aimed to inform on the stocks of products it should have at a particular point in time by analysing the demand trend of all of its products by consumers by using machine learning model forcast
 
 #ðŸ’» Project Introduction
 ---
 Corporation Favorita is a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer organization. A time series of machine learning models was to be built to forecast the demand of products in various locations. The organisation deal in the retail of different family of products from food supplies to automotives and real estates.

All analysis were conducted following the CRISP-DM framework.

## Insights from data analysis
---
The dataset provided were train, test, stores, oil, transaction, sample_submission and holiday_events. However, the main dataset used in the analysis were the train and test datasets whiles the other supplementary datasets were useful in answering the hypothesis and the questions of interest.

## Hypothesis and Questions
---
Three (3) hypothesis were stated for the regression analysis.
1
**H0** - The type of day does not play a significant role in determining the demand for oil

**H1** - the type of day play a significant roles in determining the demand for oil

2
**H0** - The location does not have an impact for the for the demand for oil

**H1** - The location have an impact for the demand for oil

3
**H0** - There is no significant correlation between oil price and increase sales

**H1** - There is significant correlation between oil price and increase sales


Questions
---
1. Is the train dataset complete (has all the required dates)?
2. Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year?
3. Are certain groups of stores selling more products? (Cluster, city, state, type)
4. Are sales affected by promotions, oil prices and holidays?
5. What analysis can we get from the date and its extractable features?
6. What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, MSE (or why is the MAE greater than all of them?)
7. What is the relationship between oil prices and sales?
8. What is the relationship between product and sales?
9. What is the trend of sales overtime ?
10. What is the relationship between oil prices and promotion ?
